## Description

* _This application takes age from the user and converts it to galactic age by multiply that input with a formula depending on the planet. The user also get to see their life expectancy depending on their age and weight_
* _The project outline takes in 3 .js files and a .html file accompanied by TDD best practises. The main.js is the entry point while age.js file include the functionality accompanied by age.test.js which runs the tests_
* _We have functions for each planets age and a subsequest test based on each outcome formula to calculate the age to that planet_
* _we also have one more function in the age.test.js folder to calculate life expectancy using base age minus input age then multiplying by absolute weight determiner_
