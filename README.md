Business Logic
let monthCode; Get user input than translate that to our Code based on the monthCodeObj 
let dayCode = ('#input').val()
let yearCode = Get from formula based on user input
 
1. Number for every month
  If else statement for Leap Year with this condition
  For a Leap Year * January is 5 and February is 1 but that will be explained shortly.

  const monthCodeObj = {
    January: 6,
    February: 2,
    January Leap Year: 5,
    February Leap Year: 1,
    March: 2,
    April: 5,
    May: 0,
    June: 3,
    July: 5,
    August: 1,
    September: 4,
    October: 6,
    November: 2,
    December: 4
  }

2. Code for every year
  1. Take last 2 digits of any year
  2. Divide by 4 and ignore the remainder
  3. If no remainder its a Leap year and the January code is 5 and Febuary code is 1
  4. Then add that answer to the last 2 digits of the year
  5. Divide by 7 and the remainder is the code

  if else statement to determine if its a leap Year 

 (Math.floor((Last 2 digits of Year) / 4) = (last 2 digits of Year)) / 7 = Answer
 Answer - Math.floor(Answer) = Remainder = Day of week

3. Month Code (get from monthCodeObj) + Day (get from user Input) + Year Code (We have to calculate) = Answer / 7 remainder is day of week

Test Dates:
January 21 2020
1. Month Code: 5 Leap year
2. Year Code: 4
  1. 20
  2. 20 / 4 = 5
  3. Leap year = 5
  4. 5 + 20 = 25
  5. 25 / 7 = 3 remainder is 4
3. 5 + 21 + 4 = 30 / 7 = 4 remainder 2 = Tuesday

June 23, 2021
1. Month Code: 3
2. Year Code: 5
  1. 21
  2. 21 / 4 = 5
  3. Not a Leap Year
  4.  5 + 21 = 26
  5. 26 /  7 = 3 remainder is 5 
3. 3 + 23 + 5 = 31 / 7 = 4 remainder is 3 = Wednesday
